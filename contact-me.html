    <h1>HOW TO CONTACT ME</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Given my hefty schedule as an undergraduate mathematics major, I try as much as possible to 
        dedicate my extra time by indulging myself in knowledge. If 
        you have an offer, opportunity, or introduction that might make my life more interesting, 
        e-mail me at jeremie.notebaert@gmail.com. For the reasons stated above, I'll only respond to 
        those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests. If you'd like to contact 
        me, know that the following two types of e-mail I certainly won't respond to:
        <br>
        <br>
        <input type="checkbox">(1) I am not asking Jeremie a style question I could find searching Google for 10 minutes.
        <br>
        <input type="checkbox">(2) I am not SPAMMING Jeremie with a cut-and-pasting generic request to promote my unrelated business.</p>
